# CNN-with-transfer-learning

CNN is implemented using Transfer Learning (pretrained on Resnet50) on three large data sets viz. CIFAR10, CALTECH101 and CALTECH256

* Google drive link for the Caltech101/256 datasets is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OglRg5Mhieyanp1hQCalgbeV6ikv56Z4?usp=sharing 

* Libraries used:  pandas, numpy, matplotlib, torch

* For Caltech101/256, since 30 images per category was to be selected to construct the training dataset and the remaining for testing dataset, 
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/scene-15-image-classification-problem-with-transfer-learning-231962b85c6e was followed for preparing the train and test dataset

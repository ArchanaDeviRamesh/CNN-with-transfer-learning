# CNN-with-transfer-learning

CNN is implemented using Transfer Learning on three large data sets viz. CIFAR10, CALTECH101 and CALTECH256

* Google drive link for the Caltech101/256 datasets is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OglRg5Mhieyanp1hQCalgbeV6ikv56Z4?usp=sharing 

* For Caltech101/256, since 30 images per category was to be selected to construct the training dataset and the remaining for testing dataset,
